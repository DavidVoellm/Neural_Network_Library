# Neural Networks Library

My idea of programming a library for Neural Networks started in 2021. I've began watching a lot of Youtube-Turorials about Machine Learning and programming in general. My experience before that had been Arduino, HTML/CSS/JS, LEGO-Mindstorms and Scratch, so to say the obvious, I was a bloody beginner.

## First Try Outs

In 2021 I got a Laptop from school because we had homeschooling and I started programming on it. I downloaded Python, Arduino and started designing my first networks in Google-Colab (with tensorflow). Soon I also found a good tutorial to make my own Neural Networks (sentdex) and till then I had already a pretty good understanding of the logic behind a Neural Network, so all that was left was to be able to program it. I had multiple runs where I started this project again. Every time I ended up on a new problem, where often my understanding and motivation was done, but I always got on step further.

## This Project

This year 2022/23 I decided again to build a new version, that finally could optimize a Network efficiently. Now in January, school has got back to regularity and my routine got started. For not falling in a routine where I don't continously conciously improve, I decided it's time to continue on this journey and start a new Neural Network project!
