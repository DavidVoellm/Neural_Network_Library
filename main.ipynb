    "# Neural Networks Library\n",
    "\n",
    "My idea of programming a library for Neural Networks started in 2021. I've began watching a lot of Youtube-Turorials about Machine Learning and programming in general. My experience since then had been Arduino, HTML/CSS/JS, LEGO-Mindstorms and Scratch, so to say the obvious, i was a bloody beginner.\n",

    "## First Try Outs\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2021 I got a Laptop from school because we had homeschooling and I started programming on it. I downloaded Python, Arduino and started first designing my first networks in Google-Colab (with tensorflow). Soon I also found a good tutorial to make my own Neural Networks (sentdex) and till then I had already a pretty good understanding of the logic behind a Neural Network, so all that was left was to be able to program it. I had multiple runs where I started this project again. Every time I ended up on a new problem, where often my understanding and motivation was done, but I always got on step further.\n",

    "## This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This year 2022/23 I decided again to build a new version, that finally could optimize a Network efficiently. The first part of the year I took long time to build my mindset and decide what to focus on. In november I started my changing my daily mindset bit by bit, till in december I got to the decision to make less excuses and let what I had prepared in my head outside in my life. I changed my daily routine drastically and tried to stop instant gratification so I can build powerful habits.\n",
    "Now in January, school has got back to regularity and my routine took a lot of will power but is still standing. For not falling in a routine where I don't continously conciously improve, I decided it's time to continue on this journey and start a new Neural Network project! "
